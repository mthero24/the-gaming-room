Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The gaming room client is a company who has an adroid game called draw it or lose it. They want to develop there game as a web app to allow for cross platform play. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think my analysis of the characterist of the various platform and recomendations are spot on for what is need to create a high fuctioning game that will give the best user expiernce.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I found the the ULM Digram the most usful in developing the code. It gives a road map of where the development needs to go and how to get there.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
probably the design constraints section. I think I probably could have done a better job knowing what I know now.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I listend to what the said about wanting the app to be web based to support cross platform play. It is important to consider the users needs because that is who we design for. Satisfying the users needs it the point of developing software. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approched designing this software like I do all development projects I do. I first figure out what the customer wants. Then I research the best way of getting what the customer needs. Then I develop the software in a way I can provide what the customer needs and then try to add things the customer dosent know they want yet until they have it.
